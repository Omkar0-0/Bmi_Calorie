# BMI & Calorie Calculator

A simple web application to calculate **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and estimate daily **calorie requirements** based on user inputs like age, gender, height, weight, and activity level.

## 🚀 Features

- BMI Calculator with result interpretation (underweight, normal, overweight, obese)
- Calorie Requirement Estimator (BMR + activity level)
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Built with streamlit

## 🧮 How It Works

### ✅ BMI Formula:


### ✅ Calorie Formula (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation):

- For Men:  
  `BMR = 10 × weight + 6.25 × height − 5 × age + 5`
- For Women:  
  `BMR = 10 × weight + 6.25 × height − 5 × age − 161`

Then multiply by an activity factor to get daily calorie needs.
